# StuckInSpaceBackup
 This is my game stuck in space. It was invisioned as a game that could be easily accessed and used for interactive teaching on different subjects with an ability to easily expand to add more and more questions. It plays with 0 gravity and was part of my series of games created in a week during game development third semester in the second year
